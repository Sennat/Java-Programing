To get a response from the server, the client creates a "receive" packet 
and uses the DatagramSocket Ok, so here we can see that the server replies 
with the same message with "OK : " prepended.Multiple ncat terminals can 
connect to this udp server. Open another terminal and connect using the 
same command and try sending messages from both client terminals. The 
server would reply to each. Since the concept of "connection" does not 
exist in udp, the same loop can handle multiple connections much like the 
select function of c socket library.
